1. `$GHOST_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.ghost/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
GHOST_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

Ghost in the Shell includes two built-in agents you can switch between,
you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multi-step tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Building on Ghost in the Shell

If you are working on a project that's related to Ghost in the Shell and is using "ghost" as a part of its name; for example, "ghost-dashboard" or "ghost-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the Ghost in the Shell team and is not affiliated with us in anyway.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [Ghost in the Shell Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); Ghost in the Shell can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. Ghost in the Shell is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow Ghost in the Shell to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What's the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).
